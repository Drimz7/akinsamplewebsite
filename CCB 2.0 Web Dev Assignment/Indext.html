          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny’s worth.
        </p>

          “I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
          looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best—and most grueling—time of my life. Since completing
          the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software
          Engineer at a VR startup.”

        <p>The team was very supportive and kept me motivated.</p>
        <p>
          “I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now
          work as a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one of the best
          investments I've made in myself.”

          “Thank you for the wonderful experience! I now have a job I really
          enjoy, and make a good living while doing something I love.”

        <h3>Patrick Abrams</h3>

        <p>
          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
          Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
          easy.
        </p>
        <p>
          “The staff seemed genuinely concerned about my progress which I find
          really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be
          able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
          developer. The standard is above and beyond. This was one of the best
          investments I made in myself.”

        <h3>Kira Whittle</h3>

        <p>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
        <p>
          “Before joining the bootcamp, I’d never written a line of code. I
          needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
          The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
          hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
          next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've
          often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
          developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!”
